DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES DIRECTLY!

DO NOT DEPLOY THESE FILES!

The purpose of this directory is as a copy-source for creating new routes. When
a new route is needed, just copy the files in this directory (EXCLUDING THIS
README FILE) to the new route location, and RENAME ANY "CHANGME" FIELDS.

Route naming guideline:

/ = root
/myroute = myroute
/myroute/two = myroute-two
/myroute/two/[variableslug] = myroute-two-[variableslug]
